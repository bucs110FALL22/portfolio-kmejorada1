# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
The goal of my project is for the user to pick whether they are a cat or dog person, and then to give them a fact about the animal they respond with. The user will then be prompted to pick a number 1-10, and they will get a fact based on what number they respond with.
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
I am unable to retrieve any data from the API, so the result will come out as none when I pick cats and I get a file error when I pick dogs.
## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
None
## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
Sorry my code doesn't fully work please go easy on me
